* Ph.D and ME, Jan. 2007, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.
* BE, July 2000, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China.


Projects
========

* Tracking and Motion Analysis of Articulated Objects based on Manifold
  Learning, funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China, from Jan.
  2009 to Dec. 2011.


Research Interests
==================

* Detection, recognition, tracking, and behavior recognition of visual objects
   * Applications of manifold learning in articulated objects visual tracking
   * Low level and high level motion analysis, and applications (e.g. FRUC)
   * Image and video processing

* Human visual system
   * Perception imitation and saliency detection
   * Biology inspired visual recognition

* Image representation
   * Sparse domain (compressive sensible or not)
   * Manifold patches
   * Bag-of-words

* Smart embedded surveillance devices
   * Especially on the TI-DM644x platform
